Compile code. Run MainController Class. Enter Values. Close program to exit.

My program is run by inputting values in the Environmental GUI and in the 
other GUI that you want to Test out with the Environment values, such as
Temperature, Soil Moisture, and Humidity.
 
The Environmental GUI contains the inputs for Enviromental Temperature which is the 
temperature outside the green house, a temperature effect which would 
add the rate which the outside temperature is increasing if it is sunny.
It also contains Environmental Soil Moisture which is the moisture outside the
greenhouse and a negative moisture effect going on outside the Greenhouse
the user input should be positive, this will decrease the soil moisture.
In addition the GUI contains Environmental humidity which is the current 
humidity outside the Greenhouse, and a negative humidity input which decreases
the humidity inside the greenhouse.

The Temperature GUI contains a label of current Temperature in which under
the current temperature of the greenhouse is shown.
There is a Desired Temperture input in which the user puts in their 
desired comfort temperature they want the green house to be in. The upper and lower
maximum and minimum is used to input the users desired temperature comfort zone.
If the greenhouse temperature is above or below these values it trigers the
Airconditior or Furnace depending on the temperature.
The status of whether the Ac or the Furnace is On or Off is displayed besides
their respective label.
The cooling rate and the heating rate input are used on how much
celcius per minute the Ac will cool or the Furnace will heat the Greenhouse.
The Update Rate input is used to input how fast the user wants his 
current temperature to be updated at.
The Current Temperature will be displayed and be shown changing under the
Current Temperature label being updated if the environmental temperature
outside the greenhouse is higher or lower then the comfort zone temperature.
This GUI and the other two GUI needs the values inputed from the 
Environmental GUI in order to work. But each GUI only require environmental
inputs effecting them. For example Enviromental Temperature and temperature effect
inputs are needed to make the Temperature GUI to work.

The Soil Moisture GUI contains a label of current Moisture in which under
the current moisture of the greenhouse is shown.
There is a Desired Moisture input in which the user puts in their 
desired comfort moisture they want the green house to be in. 
The upper and lower maximum and minimum is used to input the users 
desired moisture comfort zone.
If the greenhouse moisture is below the lower minimum it triggers the
Sprinkler which will then increase the moisture to the desired moisture
the user wants.
The status of whether the Sprinkler is On or Off is displayed besides
its label.
The Moisture change rate is used on how much
percentage per minute the Sprinkler will water the Greenhouse.
The Update Rate input is used to input how fast the user wants his 
current moisture to be updated at.
Enviromental Moisture and negative moisture effect
inputs are needed to make the Soil Moisture GUI to work.

The Humidity GUI contains a label of current Humidity in which under
the current humidity of the greenhouse is shown.
There is a Desired Humidity input in which the user puts in their 
desired comfort humidity they want the green house to be in. 
The upper and lower maximum and minimum is used to input the users 
desired humidity comfort zone.
If the greenhouse humidity is below the lower minimum it triggers the
Humidifier which will then increase the humidity to the desired humidity
the user wants.
The status of whether the Humidity is On or Off is displayed besides
its label.
The Humidity change rate is used on how much
percentage per minute the Humidifier will humiditify the Greenhouse.
The Update Rate input is used to input how fast the user wants his 
current humidity to be updated at.
Enviromental Humidity and negative humidity effect
inputs are needed to make the Humidity GUI to work.

Once the Start button is pressed it takes all the values into account and gives
the current value such as current Temperature, moisture and humidtiy
under the current text in each respective GUI.

All three can work together or seperately as long as their Environmental
values are respectively inputed.
